# Volunteer data skills to make a positive impact

So far, you have been learning how data analytics professionals are making an impact in a variety of industries. You’ve also learned about nonprofit organizations, and how their efforts are making a difference for so many in need. By volunteering their expertise and time, data analytics professionals contribute to many projects that help nonprofits benefit communities all around the world. In this reading, you will learn more about how you can contribute to global efforts, including  your local community as a data professional.

## Nonprofits

People hoping to further a social cause, or provide a benefit to the public, often create nonprofit groups. The main mission of a nonprofit group is to fill a need or gap that the private sector is not addressing adequately. There are rewarding and inspiring opportunities for data professionals in the nonprofit sector. At the global level, groups like [Children International](https://www.children.org/), [Doctors Without Borders](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/), and [Care International](https://www.care-international.org/) lead humanitarian efforts across the globe. In addition to these large-scale efforts, there are many nonprofit organizations whose efforts are regionally specific, like [Christopher’s Promise](http://www.christopherspromise.org/) based in the Columbus, Ohio area.

You can apply your data skills to help nonprofit groups become more effective, allowing them to anticipate and respond to their greatest areas of need.

You may already be aware of nonprofits that fit within your areas of interest or operate in your community. One way that these organizations compensate for their lack of resources is by finding volunteers. Often, regional or local organizations lack the resources to offer full time employment for marketing professionals or data analysts. As a data analytics professional there are many ways that you can make a valuable contribution to nonprofit organizations. In the event that you do not have a specific nonprofit organization in mind, you can research through [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), the largest and most trusted online nonprofit evaluation and rating tool in the world. Here you will find ratings on nearly 200,000 nonprofits.

## An example of a community-based nonprofit organization

[Christopher’s Promise](http://www.christopherspromise.org/home.html), a grass-roots nonprofit based in Columbus, Ohio, is a representative example of the types of community-based nonprofits that are making an impact all over the world. This organization was inspired by the efforts to create a bicycle for a fifteen-year old who faced the challenges of Neurofibromatosis, Cerebral Palsy, and Optic Glioma. Since 2011, this nonprofit has facilitated the design and construction of adaptive bicycles for hundreds of children, thanks to outstanding support from the local communities in the central Ohio area.

Christopher’s Promise (2022) mission statement is  “To allow all kids, despite physical limitations, the ability to experience the same hallmark childhood memories as their peers. Helping kids, be kids.”

## Volunteering data skills to nonprofits

As a data analytics professional, your skills can make a great impact on charity and nonprofit organizations within your own community or for a community whose needs resonate with you. Many nonprofits are highly dependent on volunteers for their activities due to limited resources. This situation is especially challenging for community-based initiatives that often lack the funding to hire data analytics professionals. Therefore, offering to volunteer with a local nonprofit is an excellent way to gain experience and support a cause.

### How can data analytics professionals help nonprofits?

Data analytics professionals can help nonprofit organizations in a variety of ways. Below are a few examples.

#### Fundraising

Using data analytics, you can predict with high accuracy which prospects are most likely to donate. In order to maximize return on marketing and outreach expenses, nonprofit organizations can use data analysis to prioritize outreach and reduce overall marketing expenditures.

#### Marketing

There is valuable information in a nonprofit’s data that can benefit marketing efforts. Data analysis can help determine a nonprofit’s target audience and gather insights such as donation methods, contribution history, and other demographics. As a result, the nonprofit can help guide communication with potential donors and determine the effectiveness of campaigns.

#### Monitoring activities

Data analysis can help nonprofits monitor resources, expenses, and daily operational needs. A nonprofit will often need assistance in keeping track of donated materials. For example, a database of donations to a food bank could help the organization determine specific food items being collected and inventory the expiration dates of food items for shelving, cycling, and distribution. Using a system of real-time inventory in conjunction with predictive data analytics could anticipate shortages and identify those donors who have helped provide these items in the past.

Data analytics has a lot to offer a nonprofit organization. Gaining deeper insight into the organization’s efforts can help them to operate in a more effective and efficient way. Analyzing data can improve various nonprofit functions, such as allocation of resources, recruiting and retaining supporters, fundraising, and conducting research. Data analysis also can help reveal patterns and power dynamics that can be used to inform decision-making. In addition to identifying individuals and communities in need of assistance, predictive modeling can also be used to identify potential recipients of a nonprofit's services.

## More opportunities to volunteer

There are organizations who are helping to pair data professionals with projects that are making a difference all around the world.

DataKind is a global nonprofit that harnesses the power of data science and artificial intelligence (“AI”) in the service of humanity. Using data analysis, this organization guides restorative efforts in underserved communities. DataKind brings together volunteer experts from academia and industry to design innovative solutions to tough social challenges. They help social organizations apply their data to predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and AI in a way that both increases impact and is sensitive to ethical considerations. Visit the [DataKind website](https://www.datakind.org/join-us/volunteer/) to find out more about their mission and how to become a volunteer.

Another option for putting your data skills to good use are hackathons. A hackathon is an event where programmers and other data professionals come together and collaborate on a particular project. The goal is to create a solution to an existing problem.

There are many hackathon events scheduled across the world each year. These events can take place at a specific location or remotely across the globe. Hackathon events are commonly built around a central theme or question, such as tracking industrial emissions, promoting healthy food options, or how we can improve mental health for cancer patients. If you are interested in finding listings of current hackathons around the world, visit [Devpost.com](https://devpost.com/).

## Key takeaways

Donating your time to a nonprofit is a great way to gain experience, and it can be mutually beneficial for you and the nonprofit. The nonprofit benefits from your data analysis expertise, and you get valuable experience working with data that can be added to your professional portfolio.

Working with a nonprofit organization or participating in a hackathon event introduces you to different types of projects, enhances interpersonal and communications skills, and adds to your professional list of contacts. No matter what your level of data analytics experience, working with nonprofits and hackathons can be a rewarding side project, or even a philanthropic career option.

# Critical data security and privacy principles

You have learned how data analytics can be used for good causes, like assisting nonprofit organizations. Also, you learned that data professionals need to protect privacy within data and remain aware of other considerations, like data bias and making assumptions about data.

As a data analytics professional, you have a responsibility to handle data ethically. Data ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used. Throughout your career you will work with a lot of data. This sometimes includes PII, or **personally identifiable information,** which can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. One element of treating data ethically is ensuring that the privacy and security of that data is maintained throughout its lifetime. In this reading, you will learn more about the importance of data privacy and some strategies for protecting the privacy of data subjects.

## Privacy matters

Data privacy means preserving a data subject’s information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. This is also called information privacy or data protection. Data privacy is concerned with the access, use, and collection of personal data. For the people whose data is being collected, this means they have the right to:

* Protection from unauthorized access to their private data
* Freedom from inappropriate use of their data
* The right to inspect, update, or correct their data
* Ability to give consent to data collection
* Legal right to access the data

In order to maintain these rights, businesses and organizations have to put privacy measures in place to protect individuals’ data. This is also a matter of trust. The public’s ability to trust companies with personal data is important. It’s what makes people want to use a company’s product, share their information, and more.

## Protecting privacy with data anonymization

![Illustration](./assets/Ill1.png)

Organizations use a lot of different measures to protect the privacy of their data subjects, like incorporating access permissions to ensure that only the people who are supposed to access that information can do so. Another key strategy to maintaining privacy is data anonymization.

**Data anonymization** is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.

Data professionals can take additional measures to protect users and their data. **Data aggregation**, for example, is the process of collecting and combining details from a significant number of users in terms of totals or summary. Aggregating data ensures that information contained within datasets is shown in groups; when coupled with other anonymization techniques, data professionals can ensure compliance with data privacy and anonymization standards.

Data anonymization is used in just about every industry. As a data analytics professional, you probably won’t personally be performing anonymization, but it’s useful to understand what kinds of data are often anonymized before you start working with it. This data might include:

* Telephone numbers
* Names
* License plates and license numbers
* Social security numbers
* IP addresses
* Medical records
* Email addresses
* Photographs
* Account numbers

Imagine a world where we all had access to each other’s addresses, account numbers, and other identifiable information. That would invade a lot of people’s privacy and make the world less safe. Data anonymization is one of the ways we can help keep data private and secure!

## Key takeaways

For any professional working with data about actual people, it’s important to consider the safety and privacy of those individuals. That’s why understanding the importance of data privacy and how data that contains PII can be made secure for analysis is so important. We have a responsibility to protect people’s data and the personal information that data might contain.

If you’re interested in learning more about data privacy and ethics, you can check out [the Google Data Analytics Certificate program’s section on bias, credibility, privacy, ethics, and access](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/home/week/2).


# The practices and principles of good data stewardship

As you have been learning, all data professionals are responsible for ensuring the quality, integrity, accessibility, and security of data. Data stewardship is the practice of ensuring that data is accessible, usable, and safe. Making data stewardship a normal part of your work habits will benefit everyone who relies on your analysis, both inside and outside of your organization. In this reading, you will learn more about data stewardship and receive some best practices that can assist in guiding your career in data analytics.

## Respect privacy

Earlier in this course, you learned about Information that permits the identity of an individual to be inferred by either direct or indirect means. This kind of information is commonly referred to as personally identifiable information or PII. When users share personal information, they are putting a high level of trust into an organization. It is the responsibility of all who have access within the organization to help protect the privacy of their users. As a data analytics professional, it is important to be thoughtful about any personal data and exhibit great care to protect it. In different parts of the world, laws are in place to guide best practices for data privacy. Laws provide a foundation for best practices as you grow in knowledge and experience on how to support and sustain privacy. One of your responsibilities as a data professional will be to stay up to date with any change in data laws and regulations that govern data. Depending on your organization’s location or industry considerations, there may be additional regulations and policies in place. Here are a couple of regional examples:

* General Data Protection Regulation or [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/) (European Union law):
  * The GDPR is described on their website as the toughest privacy and security law in the world. It imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the European Union.
* Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or [LGPD](https://www.gov.br/cidadania/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/lgpd) (Brazil’s general law for the protection of personal data):
  * The LGPD is a data protection law that governs how companies collect, use, disclose, and process personal data belonging to people in Brazil. LGPD applies to companies that process data about individuals in Brazil.
* The California Consumers Privacy Act or [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) (Privacy rights for California consumers):
  * The CCPA gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them. These regulations provide guidance on how to implement the law.
  * Additionally, states like Virginia, Colorado, New York, Utah, and Connecticut have enacted similar legislation to protect consumer privacy in their states.

## Be cautious of unintentional harm

Data analytics is expanding its influence across an increasing range of industries. Companies are using the results of data analysis to make informed decisions. Many of these decisions have the potential to impact people across a broad range of social and economic factors. It is good practice to continually strive to produce information that is accurate, while respecting cultural and social norms.

Due to the global marketplace, decisions play out differently in different cultures. Taking these issues and considerations into account is very important for the executive team of an organization. Also, companies are known to take a position on particular politicized social and cultural issues, and these can be reflected in their policies. As a data analytics professional, you must be cognizant of your company’s policies. When presented with challenges, it is best to seek guidance from leadership within your organization on how to navigate.

## Avoid creating or reinforcing bias

You have learned about bias within data and how it can have an impact on your analysis. Identifying bias is not always simple. A good practice when working with data is to keep in mind that data gathering is a task managed by humans–and that process is informed by people from different backgrounds, experiences, beliefs, and worldviews. These and other types of biases can affect the data and the results, which in turn can have an impact on business decisions. You will learn more about bias within data as you progress through the program.

## Consider inclusivity

Often in your role as a data analytics professional, you will have access to data collected in a variety of ways. You will need to consider whether the methods of data collection have excluded information from particular populations. Inclusionary approaches can expand how any organization collects and analyzes data. Building diverse research teams, communicating clearly with user communities, and engaging in careful and critical analysis that considers equity and inclusion benefits all stakeholders.

## Uphold high standards of scientific excellence

The processes and technology that you will interact with as a data analytics professional are deeply rooted in the scientific method. As you continue in your data professional journey, embrace inquiry, intellectual discussion, and collaboration. Invite feedback and assess feedback. Remember, artificial intelligence still depends heavily on the instructions provided by data professionals. The more time and consideration that goes into the process of data analytics, the better the results.

Different industries have different standards. In your role as a data analytical professional, you will need to be aware of the standards for the industries you are working in. Each industry will have its own standards based on industry conventions.

Conventions that work well in the transportation industry may not necessarily be as high of a priority for the healthcare industry. For example, in transportation, data is collected to create predictive analytics models to analyze the best route based on traffic patterns. In the healthcare industry, data is analyzed in medical imaging, predicting genetic factors, and speeding up the development of treatments.

## Data stewardship and ethics conversations

As you progress through your career as a data analytics professional, you will need to consider issues of ethical concern. For example, you may encounter situations where you address questions of bias or need to protect user data and personally identifiable information (PII). When these types of questions arise, many seek guidance and support from online communities of data professionals who have dealt with similar issues. The following graphics present scenarios involving these kinds of issues. You can also find text alternative versions of these conversations in the

# Build the perfect data team

You have been learning about the role of data analytics professionals within organizations and the work they perform. You’ve also examined some general classifications for data professional roles.  Additionally, you explored what a typical data analytics profession might experience during the initial days in a new position. Large organizations often have more data needs, requiring the creation of teams to take on projects. In this reading, you will learn more about how organizations build data analytics teams and look at some best practices when constructing them.

## **Designing data analytics teams**

The idea of companies creating teams of data professionals developed over time and largely out of necessity. Originally, the responsibilities of data collection, management, and analysis fell onto the CIO (chief information officer) of the company. CIOs in the past would typically hand the responsibilities over to the IT (Informational technology) team.

Gradually, organizations began separating data functions as the wealth of information stored grew. Additionally, new technologies emerged and data-related tasks became more specialized.

### Data professional profiles within large organizations

Earlier in this course, you were introduced to some data professional profiles.

* Data Scientist
* Data Analyst
* Data Engineer
* Analytic Team Manager
* Business Intelligence Engineer

These profiles are very generalized categories that can help you focus your eventual job search. In reality, many employers are looking for more than data professionals. They are looking for project stakeholders, dependable team members, and great co-workers.

### Building the team

The data needs of larger companies requires the creation of a team of skilled professionals. The members of these teams each have a specialized area of expertise. Some will come from business backgrounds, some with project or staff management experience, while others will have more technical skills. While there is no checklist available for companies to follow when putting together their team of data professionals, the needs of their organization can help guide them.

Creating a team of data analytics professionals is very similar to how sports franchises put together championship-level rosters. Coaches and general managers are always looking to upgrade and enhance the capabilities of their teams. While having a superstar athlete can help deliver a consistent performance at a certain position, their abrupt departure can compromise the team’s overall performance. A better approach is to develop a well-balanced and collaborative team.

Employers want to hire someone who has more than data analytic skills. They are selecting the best fit for their organization. Candidates who bring additional experience and skills beyond data analytics are most often seen as most favorable. Strong interpersonal and communication skills, experience working in business, or within a team dynamic can enhance data analytics. There is a very good chance that you already possess some of these skills.

## Five principles for data team building

After you join a data team, there are still challenges to building a data-driven organization. Below you will find five principles that can guide any organization to becoming more effective when facing the challenges of data analysis, regardless of the structure of your data teams within the company.

### 1. Adaptability

Data platforms, networks and storage options need to allow flexibility. Each data professional will have their preferences as to the tools and their approaches to analysis. Remote and on-site employees need to have access and the ability to work with all data and use the tools of communication they feel are the most productive.

Organizations need to facilitate a data platform that allows open access to resources for all users. Instead of specifying specific software solutions, organizations can expand their pool of candidates by allowing individuals to integrate the tools and applications they are most comfortable and experienced with. Flexibility invites a wide range of experience and enhances data teams, adding experience and additional perspectives.

Just as organizations need to be adaptable, those seeking opportunities in data fields should be committed to learning new skills and technologies. Data workplaces are undergoing constant change, as you learned earlier. As a data analytics professional, you will continue to learn and grow as newer technologies or regulations emerge.  Accept the challenge presented by new circumstances and let yourself feel energized when presented with opportunities for professional growth.

**Pro tip: **Keep your desire for learning. Expand your knowledge through online data science communities and educational opportunities.

### 2. Activation

Access to data analysis results require someone with the background and experience of a data analyst. Even small-scale data operations require skills that go beyond the scope of other professionals within an organization.

To become more data literate, organizations should cultivate new habits and integrate them into their daily work routines. Dashboards and other accessible interfaces can help promote the use of data analysis, enabling wider usage of data analysis, promoting communication and fostering cross-departmental collaboration.

Vital to the success of an organization's efforts to transform its internal habits and culture are the interpersonal skills of its employees. When a company is seeking to expand data literacy, its data professionals play an important role. There will be opportunities to help promote understanding among peers and colleagues. The time spent answering questions and promoting understanding will help others appreciate you and your contributions to the organization.

**Pro tip:** Maintain positive professional relationships through effective communication. Your ability to share insights is just as important to an organization as your analyzing skills.

### 3. Standardization

An organization needs to set criteria for the standardization of data practices and procedures. Standardization helps to promote best practices, and communication and transferability of information between teams. When users can share optimized code and other assets it saves development time and streamlines projects. An organization that builds a culture of collaboration embeds best practices into work behaviors.

Identifying candidates with capabilities beyond data analysis is essential to developing and standardizing best practices. To develop best practices, organizations need employees that contribute innovative solutions to problems.

**Pro tip:** Become a problem solver. Obstacles within a project can turn into opportunities for innovation, which can transform an organization.

### 4. Accountability

Data analysis is a complex and dynamic process that requires a high level of accountability. To promote responsibility, organizations need a ‘paper trail’ that allows examination of their entire process.

Accountability adds transparency, explainability, and security to data teams and projects. It also helps to eliminate layers within an organization, while aligning business goals and customer values. Transparency in workflow allows organizations to answer specific questions about the data analysis process. Data analytics professionals can use project metadata to examine and communicate specific elements within their prediction models, giving data teams the collaborative ability to make adjustments with more precision.

One way to promote accountability is to extend your ability to communicate throughout your workflow. Within data analytical projects, the transfer of ideas extends beyond individual correspondence. It also includes information in project notes, records kept within projects, and proper tagging within metadata. Individual processes and ideas are the incubators of standards of practice and communicating these ideas effectively can improve an organization’s accountability.

**Pro tip: **Data analytics professionals are more than repositories of information. It benefits everyone involved in a project if you are able to communicate your knowledge and observations. Identify what would be most valuable to others and provide the information.

### 5. Business impact

Often, the inability to estimate the impact on the business can block data analysis projects. Organizations are not considering all available data analytical solutions during the planning stage.

Organizations should look at approaching data projects with the widest field of view in the planning stage. This requires a thoughtful approach including considerations beyond data analysis.  For example, the difficulty of integration, commitment of resources, and changes to the project timeline. Businesses need to consider more data solutions options and identify which benefit the project the most.

Broadening the scope of an organization takes time and consistency of results. To achieve this, a data team must become a trusted resource for insight and a positive influence on an organization's decision-making process. An effective communication strategy, strong interpersonal skills, and a track record of problem-solving will earn the trust of the organization.

**Pro tip: **Focus on communicating clearly with stakeholders. Maintain a commitment to consistency between what you have promised and what you will deliver.

## Key takeaways

Organizations carefully consider the individuals they bring into their organization and seek candidates that embody qualities that go beyond data skills. Additionally, companies can influence their adaptability by hiring data professionals that embody the spirit of lifelong learning, effective communication, interpersonal skills, and the ability to solve problems.

* *Intuition*. AI models are trained on data, and they can only make decisions based on the patterns they observe in the data. Humans can use their intuition and personal experience to make decisions that are not explicitly programmed into the AI model. For this reason, it’s important to always verify a model’s output before relying on it.
* *Deal with ambiguity.* AI models are good at solving problems that are well-defined and have clear parameters. However, humans can identify and understand complex problems that are not well-defined and have ambiguous parameters by considering key details offered in the context of the project.
* *Interpersonal communication*. AI models can generate reports and presentations, but they cannot communicate with stakeholders in the nuanced way that humans can. Humans can explain the results of their analysis to fit the needs of specific stakeholders, and use their emotional intelligence to address concerns.
* *Creativity*. AI models are good at following instructions, but they are not imaginative like humans. Humans can be creative in their approach to data analysis, and imagine new and innovative solutions to complex problems.
* *Critical thinking*. Humans can think critically about their data and identify potential biases and ethical issues. AI models are usually trained on real-world data that contains biases and are therefore likely to reflect those biases in model outputs.
* *Leadership*. Humans can be leaders, and they can motivate and inspire others. AI may have difficulty understanding the nuances of human emotion, motivation, and communication. This limits AI’s ability to effectively run an organization.
* *Factuality. *Generative AI models are trained to output text based on patterns in language. Sometimes the model output may be very well-composed and as a result, seem reliable, but may not be factual. As noted above, it’s important to always verify model output.

In the future, product and research teams may develop updates for AI that enlarge its current capabilities. However, human data professionals will continue to play an important role in data science by using their intuition, imagination, and unique experience to solve complex problems.

## Key takeaways

Data professionals can use AI to help automate tasks, make predictions, generate insights, and communicate findings. They can leverage AI to be more productive in their work and more impactful in their organizations. Overall, AI is a powerful tool for data professionals but it is not without limitations. For this reason, human oversight and intervention is critical when working with AI and related tools

Tableau is a great platform if you want to feature polished visualizations and demonstrate your ability to communicate results in an engaging and elegant way.

## **Notebooks on Kaggle**

If you prefer to compose a more technical exposition of your work, Kaggle is a great place to do it. For example, consider [Jesse Mostipak’s profile](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak). Jesse is a data professional who uses Kaggle to contribute coding exemplars and datasets, participate in modeling competitions, and converse with others in the data community.

The following is an example of a notebook she submitted as a tutorial on using XGBoost in tidymodels, which is a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning. You’ll learn how to use XGBoost with Python later in this certificate program.

In addition to supporting your public presence as a data practitioner, publishing your work this way is a great opportunity to generate discussion of different approaches and methodologies with peers in the data community and to learn new skills.

## **GitHub repositories**

Another way to feature your work is by using GitHub. GitHub is probably best known for being a version control system used by coders and developers worldwide to keep track of projects involving large codebases with many simultaneous contributors. GitHub also offers tools to create and customize user profiles and project repositories. Take [Ravin Kumar’s GitHub page](https://github.com/canyon289) for example.

Some advantages of GitHub include the ability to structure your projects into repositories, which are like folders that are accessible to other people via Git. Repositories can include Jupyter notebooks, computer programs, images and figures, and markdown exposition. You’ll work extensively with Jupyter notebooks and markdown text throughout this certificate program. GitHub also lets you watch, star, and follow users or individual projects. The platform is particularly useful for sharing code directly with other people and even working collaboratively with them on projects.

## **Blogs on Medium**

Jupyter notebooks and coding exhibitions aren’t the only means by which you can demonstrate expertise. Blog posts are another great way to propel your professional development. One of the advantages of blogs is that they showcase a wide range of highly sought-after skills beyond just technical proficiency. For example, not only will a well-written blog post convey your understanding of data concepts, tools, and techniques, but it will also emphasize your critical thinking, communication, and writing skills. These types of skills are what distinguish the best data professionals in the field.

Medium is a great platform to post data science-related blogs. You can also submit to publishers of curated data science content, such as Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, and KDNuggets. As an example, consider the following [article written by Cassie Kozykov](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-work-with-someone-elses-data-f33485d79ed4) (the instructor of this course) that was published on Towards Data Science.

This post isn’t about coding or complex computer science or mathematics at all! It’s a practical guide for avoiding pitfalls when working with third-party data. Such topics are highly relevant, and writing about them is another great way to access exciting career opportunities.

## **Other approaches**

This list isn’t exhaustive. It’s intended to give you an idea of the possibilities for presenting your work and becoming an active participant in the field. Some people share Jupyter notebooks, others write helpful articles, and others create podcasts or YouTube videos. For example, consider[ this YouTube video on bias in machine learning and AI, produced by Angelica Spratley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2gTrr0SKuI), a data scientist and educator.

By the way, bias is something you’ll learn about in the course on machine learning. Find what excites you, and your enthusiasm will be evident. The possibilities are vast if you follow your imagination and motivation to contribute to the exciting world of data.

## **Key Takeaways**

These are just a few ways you can share your work. One of the great things about doing so is that it gives you a public-facing profile that employers can review. If someone searches for your name and finds an impressive portfolio, it gives you more opportunity to stand out. Additionally, presenting your work forces you to clearly explain (and thus understand) your methodologies, making you a stronger data practitioner. Whichever way you choose to share your work, be creative, have fun, and don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. This is your opportunity to impress!
