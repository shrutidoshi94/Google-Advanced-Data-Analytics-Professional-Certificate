* [Course 1 PACE strategy document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaTEjQY1qFWOhNAK7n3lyUoXX9E8lRJ9JatRp05sNG4/template/preview?resourcekey=0-kFO66RukJ-dtCmD-QvJc3w)
* [Waze project proposal ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Teq5Y1sEBbf_kULYYlUq6-WC1G8f90bYoyQtIHVvJXg/template/preview)

### Step 2: Review the first page of the PACE strategy document

The Course 1 PACE strategy document will guide you in determining the tasks necessary to complete the project proposal. As you approach each section, keep the PACE framework in mind. Consider how and when a data professional would plan, analyze, construct, and execute each task. Begin by reading through the instructions and information on page 1 of the PACE strategy document.

### Step 3: Complete the Data Project Questions & Considerations

In the Data Project Questions & Considerations section of the PACE strategy document, you are presented with questions designed to help you unlock a deeper understanding of data analytics. Complete the questions in this section.

### Step 4: Complete the PACE workflow

In the PACE workflow section of the PACE strategy document, you are presented with a list of tasks identified as necessary for the Waze project. Classify these tasks into the appropriate PACE stages and explain each classification.

### Step 5: Complete the project proposal

As part of your work on the PACE strategy document, you identified PACE stages for tasks that need to be completed in the Waze project. This information will help you assign tasks to milestones in the** Waze project proposal. **Complete the project proposal by:

* Entering a project title
* Adding an overview of the project
* Identifying the order of tasks
* Associating each task with the relevant milestone
* Determining the PACE stage(s) for each task*
* [Optional task] Assigning each task to the most relevant stakeholder

*Note that some tasks may be associated with more than one PACE stage. To connect more than one stage with a task, copy and paste the **Select PACE stage** dropdown menu and select an additional stage.

## **Pro Tip: Save the templates**

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the templates you used to complete this activity. You can use them for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

## Assessment of Exemplar

### Course 1 PACE strategy document

Compare the exemplar to your completed PACE strategy document. Your responses may differ from the exemplar, but that is to be expected. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you progress through the course.

***Note:**** The exemplar represents one possible way to address the PACE questions and classify project tasks according to the PACE workflow. Yours may differ in certain ways, such as your specific responses to questions. What’s important is that you have a general idea of the order and PACE-stage classification for tasks in the data analysis process.*

Your replies to the Course 1 PACE strategy document should:

* Be relevant to Waze project goals and related to data science
* Demonstrate your understanding of the business scenario
* Communicate the reasoning behind your decisions to pair PACE stages with specific tasks

### Course 1 Waze project proposal

Compare the exemplar to the Waze project proposal you completed. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you progress through the course.

***Note:**** The exemplar represents one possible way to complete the Waze project proposal. Yours may differ in certain ways, such as specific task assignments, PACE stages, or relevant stakeholders. What’s important is that you have an overall understanding of the purpose and organization of project proposals for data-driven work.*

Your project proposal should:

* Clearly communicate the overall project goal
* Identify key tasks, milestones, and stakeholders
